# e-plantShopping
This repository contains my final project for IBM's *Developing Front-End Apps with React* course, part of the *IBM Full Stack Developer Professional Certificate* on Coursera. 

The goal of this project was to apply core React concepts by transforming a provided starter template into a fully interactive e-commerce application using React and Redux.

## Course Information 
*Developing Front-End Apps with React* is part of IBM's *Full Stack Developer Professional Certificate*. The course provides a strong foundation in React, focusing on how it works under the hood and how to apply it in real-world applications. Throughout the course, I learned React fundamentals through hands-on labs and projects using IBM's skill network. These projects leveraged Vite as the build tool, chosen for it's efficient workflow to build applications.

## Project Purpose
*Paradise Nursery* is an online plant shop that sells a variety of houseplants. The purpose of this project was to implement the core functionality of the shop using React and Redux, turning a static template into a dynamic, state-driven application.

## My Role
As the front-end developer, I was responsible for implementing application functionality using React and Redux. My tasks included: 
- Enabling users to browse a catalog of houseplants
- Displaying relevant product details for each item
- Implementing a shopping cart with add and remove functionality
- Managing global application state using Redux
- Ensuring seamless navigation between pages without losing cart data
- Deploying the completed application to GitHub Pages

## Tech Stack
- Vite - Build tool and development server
- JavaScript - Application logic
- React - User Interface library
- Redux - Global state management
- HTML - Structure
- CSS - Styling
- GitHub Pages - Deployment

## Getting started
You can explore the project either by running it locally or by viewing the deployed version on GitHub Pages.

### Accessing with GitHub Pages

View the live application here: [https://angell-015.github.io/e-plantShopping/](https://angell-015.github.io/e-plantShopping/)

The project is deployed and accessible online through GitHub Pages. You can view the live application using the following steps:

1. Open the repository on GitHub.
2. Click on the **"Pages"** section in the repository **Settings**.
3. Locate the **GitHub Pages URL** (usually in the format: `https://<your-username>.github.io/e-plantShopping/`).
4. Open this URL in your browser to access the live application.

### Run the Project Locally
1. Clone the repository

    `github clone <repository-url>`

2. Navigate into the project directory
    
    `cd e-plantShopping`

3. Install Dependencies
    
    `npm install`

4. Start the preview server
    
    `npm run preview`

## What I Learned
### React Fundamentals
- Learned how the Virtual DOM works to efficiently update UI.
- Introduced to React Hooks: `useState`, `useEffect`, `useContext`, and learned how custom hooks are used.
- Explored the types of components including functional, class, and HOC and how they are building blocks in UI.

### Redux
- Learned how Redux provides predictable global state management.
- Implemented core concepts: **actions**, **reducers**, and the **store**.
- Understood when and why to use Redux. It benefits larger applications particularly those who want a centralized state and easier data access across components.

### Vite
- Learned the benefits of Vite: Fast and efficient development, modern Javascript support, and small build size.
- Explored Vite's project structure, directories and files. 
- Gained a broader understanding of build tools and their general purpose.
