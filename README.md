# coding-project-template
This is my final project for the React course provided by IBM through Coursera. My role was to add functionality to the E-plant store using React and Redux, transforming the provided template into a fully interactive application.

## What I have learned from this course so far:
- Improved understanding of JavaScript: I applied my existing JavaScript knowledge and strengthened my skills with array methods such as map, find, filter, and others.

- React fundamentals: I learned how React works, including state management, functional components, differences between types of state, and how React updates the UI using the Virtual DOM.

- Redux: I learned how Redux operates alongside React to manage global state in a predictable and organized way.
